            Makie.jl and its backends, with emphasis on CairoMakie.jl (vector drawing) and RPRMakie.jl (raytracing).
          </p>
          <p class="is-size-5"> 
            GeoMakie.jl, a package which enables easy visualization for geographic plots. I was the primary author of this package.

          <p class="is-size-5">
            <a href="https://github.com/fatteneder/MakieSlides.jl">MakieSlides.jl</a>, an engine 
            to write and render interactive presentations using Makie.jl.  Contributed to this library
            (written primarily by <a href="https://github.com/fatteneder">Florian Atteneder</a>).
          </p>
          <p class="is-size-5">
            <a href="https://github.com/asinghvi17/Polylabel.jl">Polylabel.jl</a>, a port of a JavaScript library 
            which finds the optimal point to label a polygon.  
            
            This was written to be as generic as possible, and works with any arbitrary <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGeo/GeoInterface.jl">GeoInterface.jl</a> geometry.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Scientific computing</h2>
          <p class="is-size-5">
            <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/RecurrenceAnalysis.jl">RecurrenceAnalysis.jl</a>, a library in the JuliaDynamics organization 
            in which I parallelized code which calculates <it>recurrence matrices</it>, matrices of distance between two timeseries.
          </p>

          </p>

          <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
          <p class="is-size-5">
            <a href="https://github.com/asinghvi17/ReactGPT.jl">ReactGPT.jl</a>, a toy implementation of the ReAct framework for ChatGPT, using OpenAI's API, before OpenAI plugins came out.  It was an interesting learning experience for prompt engineering and how to take advantage of large language models.
